# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products seriously, which includes not only the code base but also the scanners provided within. If you have found any issues that might have security implications, please send a report to [security@protectai.com].

**Do NOT open an issue on the GitHub repository, as doing so makes it public knowledge.**

Your report should include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue

### Scanner Vulnerabilities or Ideas for New Security Features

In addition to code vulnerabilities, we also welcome reporting of vulnerabilities in our scanners or sharing ideas for new security features. Your input is valuable in making the use of Large Language Models safer and more secure.

Please include the following in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability or the new feature
- Steps to reproduce the issue or a detailed explanation of the feature
- If it's a new feature, any additional resources that can help understand it
